                <p class="lead">
		    Welcome to my resume website! I am delighted that you chose to visit.
		    At this moment, I am looking for an opportunity to give something back to the community
		    that recently welcomed me. 
		    Who knows, maybe I have the skills you need. 
		    Before diving into my academic achievements and work experience, I would like to
		    introduce myself and my current situation. 
	 	</p> 

		<p>
		    In the summer of 2020, I attained my master's degree from RWTH Aachen University in Germany.
		    Subsequently, I worked for a year as a research associate at the university's <i>Chair 
		    for Communication Science and the Human-Computer Interaction Center</i>.  
		    Through this job I gained more hands-on experience with human-centered research.  
		    The work included conducting two large-scale quantitative questionnaire studies
		    from beginning to end. 
		    Together with my teammates, I designed and implemented the questionnaires, collected
		    and screened the data, to then clean, analyze, and visualize it.
		    Our findings were documented in several papers, one of which has already been published. 
		    To take a look at the paper, 
		    <a target="_blank" href=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2021.717975/full?&field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Energy_Research&id=717975>
			    click here
		    </a>. 
		</p> 

		<p>
		    At the end of July 2021, I left Germany and moved to San Jose (CA, United States of America).
		    The visa that allowed me to move here requires me to wait for employment authorization before
		    I can put my knowledge into practice in a paid job.
		    In the meantime, I would hate to let my time and expertise go to waste.
		    That is why I am now looking for an opportunity to give something back to the community.
		    Ideally, I would like to work on something related to user experience research or design. 
		    For example, I could help your organization gain insight into how your services are received or 
		    assist in improving the user-friendliness of your website, system, or forms. 
		</p>

		<p> 
		    Hopefully, you have gotten a first idea of who I am now. 
		    Maybe we will get to know each other better soon! 
		    If you could use my help or if you have any unanswered questions, please use the 
		    <a class="smoothscroll" href="#contact">contact form</a> to get in touch or email me directly.

				For the computer science part, courses I attended include: <i>Virtual Reality</i>,
				<i>Web-Mining</i>, <i>Social Computing</i>, <i>Data Communication and Security</i>, 
				and <i>Efficient Algorithms</i>. 
				The communication science part of the master's dealt with topics like <i>Usability,
				User Diversity and Technology Acceptance</i> and <i>Communicative Usability</i>. 
				For my master's thesis I conducted a mixed methods empirical study in Germany and 
				the Netherlands. 
				The thesis was graded with an 1.0 (German grading system, equivalent to an A+) and 
				was titled "The acceptance and communication of insulation boards produced by means 
				of Carbon Capture and Utilization: a comparison between the Germans and the Dutch".

			        In this interdisciplinary field of study, half of the classes taught me the 
				fundamentals of computer science, and the other half communication science.
				I graduated within three years and was placed on the Dean's List twice. 
				For my bachelor's thesis I carried out and reported an empirical quantitative study. 
				The thesis was graded with an 1.0 (German grading system, equivalent to an A+) and 
				was titled "The influence of user diversity on the awareness of filter bubbles 
				regarding political opinion formation".<br> <br>

			        After six years I graduated cum laude and was equipped with the necessary 
				skills to attend a university, as well as a good mastery of the English language. 
				In the Netherlands, bilingual secondary schools are regulated by <i>Nuffic</i>, a 
				non-profit organisation that ensures the quality of the lessons and teachers.
				For me, following bilingual education meant that during the first half of secondary 
				school, all classes, except for the languages, were taught in English. 
				During the second half, lessons were taught in Dutch again, but I still had more 
				hours of English a week, as well as additional projects and exams. 
				Because of these, I was rewarded with several certificates: i.a., <i>M15 English A 
				Lang and Lit</i> by the International Baccalaureate and <i>English Language Advanced 
				Subsidiary</i> and <i>Global Perspectives Advanced Subsidiary</i> by Cambridge 
				International Examinations.
