		    Welcome to my resume website! I am delighted that you chose to visit.
	 	</p> 

		<p>
		    I am part of the first generation that grew up with everyday access to
		    the internet. Computers, in all of its many forms, have always been a part
		    of my life. Nowadays, I, and with me most others, would be lost without them. 
		    But there is a catch... 	
		</p>

		<p>
		    As technology has become ubiquitous over the course of my life, it is now more
		    important than ever before that we consider what people actually want from it.
		    Technology should make our lives easier, not more difficult. It should be intuitive
		    and easy to use, not frustrating and headache-inducing. It should bring joy and
		    excitement, not fear and resentment. That is why, as a user experience researcher,
		    I am devoted to ensuring that technology actually makes sense to its users.
		</p>

		<p>
		    My interdisciplinary field of study gave me the tools and knowledge to understand both
		    the products I aim to improve and the people that use them. I have 4+ years of
		    hands-on experience with human-centered qualitative and quantitative research and
		    speak multiple languages. After working in academics for a while, I just started my
		    working career where it all began, in Silicon Valley. I am very excited to be here
		    and to be able to contribute to what the future of technology will look like. 	
		</p>

		<p>
		    This website cannot have answered all the questions you might have about me. 
		    Please feel free to get in touch by using the 
		    <a class="smoothscroll" href="#contact">contact form</a> or email me directly.
		    I would love to chat!

			        My master's studies built further on the bachelor with the same name. 
				For the computer science part, courses I attended include: <i>Virtual Reality</i>,
				<i>Web-Mining</i>, <i>Social Computing</i>, <i>Data Communication and Security</i>, 
				and <i>Efficient Algorithms</i>. 
				The communication science part of the master's dealt with topics like <i>Usability,
				User Diversity and Technology Acceptance</i> and <i>Communicative Usability</i>. 
				For my master's thesis I conducted a mixed methods empirical study in Germany and 
				the Netherlands. 
				The thesis was graded with an 1.0 (German grading system, equivalent to an A+) and 
				was titled "The acceptance and communication of insulation boards produced by means 
				of Carbon Capture and Utilization: a comparison between the Germans and the Dutch".

				fundamentals of computer science, and the other half communication science.
				I graduated within three years and was placed on the Dean's List twice. 
				For my bachelor's thesis I carried out and reported an empirical quantitative study. 
				The thesis was graded with an 1.0 (German grading system, equivalent to an A+) and 
				was titled "The influence of user diversity on the awareness of filter bubbles 
				regarding political opinion formation".<br> <br>

			        After six years I graduated cum laude and was equipped with the necessary 
				skills to attend a university, as well as a good mastery of the English language. 
				In the Netherlands, bilingual secondary schools are regulated by <i>Nuffic</i>, a 
				non-profit organisation that ensures the quality of the lessons and teachers.
				For me, following bilingual education meant that during the first half of secondary 
				school, all classes, except for the languages, were taught in English. 
				During the second half, lessons were taught in Dutch again, but I still had more 
				hours of English a week, as well as additional projects and exams. 
				Because of these, I was rewarded with several certificates: i.a., <i>M15 English A 
				Lang and Lit</i> by the International Baccalaureate and <i>English Language Advanced 
				Subsidiary</i> and <i>Global Perspectives Advanced Subsidiary</i> by Cambridge 
				International Examinations.

				For this purpose, we conducted step-wise multiple linear regressions to find

			    	This paper is currently in the process of being published. 
				Using k-means clustering we segmented the respondents from an online questionnaire
				into three acceptance groups: rejecters, tentative accepters, and strong accepters.
				We then proceeded to evaluate how these groups differ regarding their demographics,
				personality traits, trust in relevant actors, and information and communication
				needs. These insights were used to formulate managerial communication for CCU and
				the insulation boards. We thereby differentiated between general and targetd group-specific
				recommendations.
