		    About

                <h1>
		    More About Me
		</h1>

                <p class="lead">
		    When looking at other résumés, I often feel like everybody makes themselves out 
		    to be hardworking, quick learning team players. 
		    Quite understandable, since it is difficult to leave a good impression when
		    having to rely on written words.
		    To give you the chance to get to know me a little before diving into my academic 
		    achievemens and work experience, I will outline how these cliché terms apply to me.
		    In doing so, I hope that the impression you'll get of me will be shaped by my honesty. 
	 	</p> 

		<p>
		    Am I hardworking? I do think I am. 
		    Since I enjoy the feeling of joy that comes with success, I work hard for what I 
		    want or aim to achieve. 
		    Nevertheless, in the last couple of years it has become clear to me that to be 
		    concentrated and creative when I work, I also require time to reset.
		    I try to do this on a daily basis by getting outside to go for a walk and by 
		    practicing yoga. 
		    When I find the time, I also like to write fiction, and it is a dream of mine to 
		    become a published author one day.  
		</p> 

		<p>
		    I would not say that I am a quick learner.
		    Learning takes time. 
		    Especially when it is something completely new. 
		    Even so, I do consider myself to be motivated and open to keep on developing myself. 
		    I am not afraid to take on a challenge and I often go the extra mile to upgrade or
		    widen my skills.  
		    Nowadays, most knowledge is up for grasps, as long as you know where to look for it. 
		    Though I try to make use of this to figure out things on my own, I do know when to 
		    ask for help as well. 
		</p>

		<p>
		    Finally, I would certainly not describe myself as a team player <i>yet</i>.  
		    In that statement, the <i>yet</i> is important. 
		    I am assertive, perfectionisitic, organized, and usually have a strong opinion on 
		    what I believe to be best. 
		    Though these traits are desirable in certain situations, it has made it difficult 
		    for me to collaborate with others in the past. 
		    At least, I am aware that <i>bossy</i> is not what I want to be. 
		    I like to think that my collaboration skills have already gotten better as I grew 
		    older, but I know that there is still room for improvement. 
		    Now, standing at the start of my working life, I am optimistic that, if given the 
		    chance, I will get the hang of it quickly.
		</p>
		
		<p> 
		    Hopefully, you now have a first idea of who I am. 
		    Who knows, maybe we will get to know each other better soon!

			        My master's studies built further on the bachelor with the same name. 
				For the computer science part, courses I attended include: <i>Virtual Reality</i>,
				<i>Web-Mining</i>, <i>Social Computing</i>, <i>Data Communication and Security</i>, 
				and <i>Efficient Algorithms</i>. 
				The communication science part of the master's dealt with topics like <i>Usability,
				User Diversity and Technology Acceptance</i> and <i>Communicative Usability</i>. 
				For my master's thesis I conducted a mixed methods empirical study in Germany and 
				the Netherlands. 
				The thesis was graded with an 1.0 (German grading system, equivalent to an A+) and 
				was titled "The acceptance and communication of insulation boards produced by means 
				of Carbon Capture and Utilization: a comparison between the Germans and the Dutch".

			        After six years I graduated cum laude and was equipped with the necessary 
				skills to attend a university, as well as a good mastery of the English language. 
				In the Netherlands, bilingual secondary schools are regulated by <i>Nuffic</i>, a 
				non-profit organisation that ensures the quality of the lessons and teachers.
				For me, following bilingual education meant that during the first half of secondary 
				school, all classes, except for the languages, were taught in English. 
				During the second half, lessons were taught in Dutch again, but I still had more 
				hours of English a week, as well as additional projects and exams. 
				Because of these, I was rewarded with several certificates: i.a., <i>M15 English A 
				Lang and Lit</i> by the International Baccalaureate and <i>English Language Advanced 
				Subsidiary</i> and <i>Global Perspectives Advanced Subsidiary</i> by Cambridge 
				International Examinations.
